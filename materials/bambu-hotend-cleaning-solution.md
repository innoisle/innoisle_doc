# Bambu Hotend Cleaning Solution

We’ve encountered many challenges while printing, particularly with hotend clogs. The **Bambu Labs** 3D printers, with their integrated hotend design, have proven to be especially tricky when facing these issues. Changing the hotend can be expensive and difficult, so we've been working on a way to address these clogs outside of the machine itself.

**Why We Created This Solution**

The clogged hotend issue has been a persistent problem for us, and like many others, we've struggled with downtime and the cost of replacing the hotend. The integrated design of **Bambu Labs** printers makes it even harder to swap out the hotend, so we decided to come up with our own solution.

**What We're Working On**

We’ve developed a **cleaning solution** that can help unclog the hotend **outside of the machine**, minimizing the risk of damage and extending the life of your printer. Our goal is to create a simple, effective, and cost-efficient method to tackle this issue.

**What’s Next**

If our solution proves to be effective, we will share it here with the community. Stay tuned for updates and instructions on how to use our hotend cleaning solution for your **Bambu Labs** 3D printer!
