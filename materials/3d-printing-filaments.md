# 3D Printing Filaments

### ASA Carbon Fiber (ASA-CF) Material for 3D Printing

We primarily use **ASA Carbon Fiber (ASA-CF)** material for our products. This high-performance filament is carbon fiber reinforced and designed to deliver exceptional strength, dimensional stability, and surface quality.

We used this material to print our product with Bambu Lab AMS and never had any issue.&#x20;

Hardened steel nozzle is required; we have never had a clog issue.

**Why ASA-CF?**

ASA-CF (Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate Carbon Fiber) filament is ideal for creating structural components that require:

* **High modulus and excellent surface quality**
* **Dimensional stability** and **lightweight design**
* **Ease of printing** and consistent results
* **Widely used in the automotive industry** for components that require durability and high performance
* **UV resistance**, making it suitable for outdoor and automotive applications
* **Carbon fiber reinforcement** improves rigidity and strength
* **Carbon fiber reinforcement lowers thermal expansion** compared to regular ASA, making it more stable in varying temperature conditions



**Exclusive Community Pricing & Free Shipping**

We’ve sourced this premium material in bulk, as it’s difficult to find in North America, and we want to share it with our community members at an **exclusive price**.

* **Special pricing** for community members
* **Free shipping** when you purchase this material with other items from our store



If you’re working on projects that require durable, lightweight, and high-quality 3D printed parts, this is the material for you!
