## Product Description

Both MobileEye Q3 and GM Harness are 2x13 pin harness. If you purchase a set, it will also come with a 2x13 pin harness box.

#### How to identify which version of harness box is needed:

1. If you have a harness box with rj45 port - you DO NOT need another harness box to use pedal
2. If have a harness box purchased from Comma, with no rj45 port - you will need a 2x9 pin box
3. If you plan to purchase the harness + box (GM only) from me, then it is 2x13 pin box
4. If you purchased a used harness with no box, please DM me the picture of your harness. (the old ones before 2024 June are 2x13 pin)
5. If you purchased a customized harness for Tesla, you will need a 2x13 pin box

***

## Notice

Comma released a new harness box in July 2024. Pedal support is removed.&#x20;

The new Harness box from Comma does not have RJ45 port.

If you would like to use pedal, you will need to obtain a harness box that has a RJ45 port.

**Note:** The picture below is a comma power, not a harness box. The RJ45 port on this is not equivalent to the one on Harness box
