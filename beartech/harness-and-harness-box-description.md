### Update:

The 13-pin GM harness and box have been discontinued to align with Comma’s latest hardware support. We are now exclusively providing the 9-pin version.

_Note: Legacy 13-pin specs and images will remain on our Docs page for those maintaining EON/C2 builds._

## Product Description

**GM Harness is 2x9 pin harness. If you purchase a set, it will also come with a 2x9 pin harness box.**

### **Older generation information**

2x13 pin harness and box are compatible with most of Comma's old version (before June 2024) and Clone devices\
2x9 pin harness and box are compatible with Comma's new version (after 2025)

Information about the 13 pin harness box is still kept here as a reference.

1. Harness box v1 2x13 pin. This is the harness box Comma originally carries, and it works with all of the previous 2x13 pin harness.&#x20;

2. Harness box v2 2x9 pin. This is a replacement new harness box, compatible with pedal.

All the electronic components from innoisle on this device are AEC-Q100 & AEC-Q200 qualified. All the connecting parts are from original equipment manufacturers. Assembled in Canada. 3D printed case with ASA automotive grade and UV resistant plastic.

#### How to identify which version of harness box is needed:

1. If you have a harness box with rj45 port - you DO NOT need another harness box to use pedal
2. If have a harness box purchased from Comma, with no rj45 port - you will need a 2x9 pin box
3. If you plan to purchase the harness + box (GM only) from me, then it is 2x13 pin box
4. If you purchased a used harness with no box, please DM me the picture of your harness. (the old ones before 2024 June are 2x13 pin)
5. If you purchased a customized harness for Tesla, you will need a 2x13 pin box

***

## Notice

Comma released a new harness box in July 2024. Pedal support is removed.&#x20;

The new Harness box from Comma does not have RJ45 port.

If you would like to use pedal, you will need to obtain a harness box that has a RJ45 port.

**Note:** The picture below is a comma power, not a harness box. The RJ45 port on this is not equivalent to the one on Harness box
