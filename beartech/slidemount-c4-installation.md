\*Disclaimer: This is a guide only.

**This installation guide applies to the Side Slidemount for C4**<br>

## **Set Screw Warning:**

**\*Over-tightening the set screw could break your Comma Device/ Slidemount Brackets**

**Set screw is required for Slidemount**: \
\- Set screw is NOT Pre-Installed for Side Slidemount\
\- After attaching the mount to device, tighten the pre-install set screws at the left and right side of the Slidemount.\
\- Tighten it **just enough** that you can't move the Slidemount. \
\- **Do not over-tighten it**, as the screw is small and is only intended to prevent movement. \
\- Over-tightening it will cause the **breakage of the mounting bracket or your device bracket**.&#x20;

## Installation Steps

### Before installing the slidemount, please find the description for each component in your package here:

{% content-ref url="slidemount-c4.md" %}
[slidemount-c4.md](slidemount-c4.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Please find the video installation guide after the VHB preparation

### (Optional) Prepare your VHB: (ONLY if you redo the VHB)

1. All slidemount already come with **pre-applied VHB**. \
   If you would like to **redo the VHB**, then please follow the steps to prep it.\
   Please make sure you **apply the adhesion promoter** before applying the VHB.&#x20;
2. Warning: Apply the VHB tape to the slidemount, first before you stick it on the windshield. And apply the VHB in warm temp.\
   If you are reapplying the VHB tape, Clean the surface with isopropyl alcohol and ensure that no residue remains.
3.  **(Important)** The ideal application temperature for VHB tape is above 70°F (21°C), with a minimum requirement of 50°F (10°C).

    If the temperature is below this minimum, please gently warm the application surface before and after attaching the MagMount. Exercise caution when heating the area to avoid overheating or damaging the surface.

    Please note that VHB tape requires these temperatures to cure properly. Allow the adhesive to cure for at least 24 hours (or 1.5 times the standard curing time recommended by 3M). Refer to the 3M datasheet snippet below for recommended bond times.
4. ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)
5. Take the Windshield Side Mount.
6. Wipe the back of the Windshield Side Mount with the IPA wipe.
7. Apply **adhesion promoter to every surface (except on glass)**  that the VHB is going to stick to and let it dry. (If you have windshield tint, please try it on a small area first, some tint does not do well with the adhesion promoter)
8. Apply VHB tape to the Windshield Side Mount.
9. **Clamp or use weight** on the complete slidemount for **at least 5 hours** so VHB makes perfect contact to the surface. **Every VHB-connected surface** needs to be clamped. (The complete slidemount here means slidemount with angle wedges and VHB or slidemount with mount adapter sticked together. )
