Introducing the **OP Device Stand** — the perfect solution for keeping your Comma device safe and secure while you work on updates, log uploads, or development. This **acrylic stand with a handle** allows you to place your Comma device on your desk or workspace securely, giving it a stable spot when not in use.

**Key Features:**

* **Designed for Secure Placement:** Ideal for **uploading logs, updating OpenPilot**, and for **development** purposes. It ensures that your device stays stable and secure while performing tasks.
* **Handle for Easy Mount Removal:** The built-in handle makes it easy to **pull the Magmount off** when needed.
* **Windshield or Alternative Mounting:** Requires an additional **windshield Magmount** or **Slidemount** for data transfer. If you already have a Magmount installed, you’ll need an extra windshield mount for the stand.
* **Unique Adjustable Feet Design:** For an alternative mounting option, the stand comes with **extra adjustable feet** that allow you to mount it behind your infotainment screen. This offers a lower placement if you don’t want to mount it on the windshield, reducing any potential obstruction of your view.
* **Easy Installation:** The stand comes in pieces of acrylic with 3d printed parts, and assembly is straightforward. **Installation instructions** are included to make setup easy.

Whether you're developing, uploading logs, or updating your OP, the **OpenPilot Device Stand** is the perfect solution to keep your Comma device accessible and organized.
