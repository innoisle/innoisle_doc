## Installation Guide

If you are connecting BOTH a SDSU and a pedal on your vehicle, Pedal has to connect to the harness box. It does not connect to SDSU.

If you would like to add an OBD power, it will need to be connected through a splitter.

#### Toyota:&#x20;

For installation, Jason Moreau made a wonderful video on how to install my Smart DSU and Pedal on his Rav4. He used our older version of the pedal and SDSU, but the installation method is similar. Please refer to his video:&#x20;

\*\*In this video, pedal was connected to SDSU through RJ45 port, which is WRONG.

Pedal HAS TO connect to harness box (therefore the harness box must have an rj45 port)
