**#Update: Please DO NOT use CPL filter if you have ceramic tint.**

* ☀️ **Minimize Reflections** – Cut down windshield glare and dashboard reflections that can interfere with ML performance.

#### **Why CPL Filters Matter for Comma Devices:**

CPL (Circular Polarizing Lens) filters work by **blocking polarized light**—the kind often caused by reflections on glass surfaces like your windshield. These reflections can confuse vision-based systems like OpenPilot, especially when they obscure key features like lane lines or nearby vehicles.

By adding a CPL filter, you're giving your Comma device a cleaner, clearer view of the road ahead. This results in **better model confidence**, especially in high-sun or high-glare conditions.

#### **Still Worried About View Obstruction?**

We've done extensive testing.

In the image above, you’ll see:

* 🟩 **Green box** = the actual camera feed used by OpenPilot
* 🔴 **Red circle =** the view available after applying the CPL filter.

As shown, the area used by openpilot is completely unobstructed. You get the benefit of glare reduction **without compromising vision or safety**.

#### **Compatibility:**

* ✅ Comma 3
* ✅ Comma 3X\
