# Magmount Installation Guide - After 2025Aug1st

\*Disclaimer: This is a guide only.

**This installation guide applies to the magmount purchased after Aug 2025.**\


## **Set Screw Warning:**

#### **\*Over-tightening the set screw could break your magmount**

For magmount, set screw is **not required** unless you require extra tightness.\
\- **Do not over-tighten it**, as the screw is small and is only intended to prevent movement. \
Over-tightening it will **cause the breakage of the mounting bracket**

Only tighten the set screw if the mount is loose on your comma device. By design, the mount should be a very tight fit with your comma device, and it has been tested on both C3 and C3X.&#x20;

***

## Installation Steps

### Before installing the magmount, please find the description for each component in your package here:

{% content-ref url="magmount.md" %}
[magmount.md](magmount.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### (Optional) Prepare your magmount: (ONLY if you redo the VHB)

1. Now, all magmount and angle wedge already come with **pre-applied VHB**. \
   If you would like to **redo the VHB**, then please follow the steps to prep it.\
   Please make sure you **apply the adhesion promoter** before applying the VHB.&#x20;
2. Warning: Apply the VHB tape to the magmount, angle wedges or comma mount adapter first before you stick it on the windshield. And apply the VHB in warm temp.\
   If you are reapplying the VHB tape, Clean the surface with isopropyl alcohol and ensure that no residue remains.
3. **(Important)** The ideal application temperature for VHB is above 70°F or 21°C. The minimum application temperature is 50°F and 10°C. If the temperature is lower than the minimum required, you can try to heat up the application area before and after attaching the magmount. Use common sense when heating the application area and avoid overheating or leaving it unattended. The VHB also need the above minimum required temperature for curing. Please leave it at least 24 hours or 1.5x the curing time recommended by 3M. Below is a snippet of recommended bond time from the 3M datasheet.
4. ![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)
5. Take the Windshield Side Mount and the Windshield Side Mount cover **(DO NOT open it up yet)**.
6. Wipe the back of the Windshield Side Mount with the IPA wipe.
7. **Apply adhesion promoter to every surface (except on glass)** that the VHB is going to stick to and let it dry. (If you have windshield tint, please try it on a small area first, some tint does not do well with the adhesion promoter)
8. Apply VHB tape to the Windshield Side Mount.
9. **Clamp or use weight** on the complete magmount for **at least 5 hours** so VHB makes perfect contact to the surface. **Every VHB-connected surface** needs to be clamped. (The complete magmount here means magount with VHB or the magmount with angle wedges and VHB or magmount with mount adapter sticked together. )



### Magmount Windshield and Device Side Installation Guide

1. Mark the **center position** where the Magmount will be installed

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/IMG_7114-2-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

2. Use the Wet wipes **(VHB Tape pack)** to clean the marked area on the windshield inside the vehicle
3. Use the Dry wipes **(VHB Tape pack)** to further clean the same area on the windshield
4. Use the IPA wipes **(VHB Tape pack)** to thoroughly clean the marked area on the windshield
5. Apply the Static film **(VHB Tape pack)** to the windshield. **Note**: If your local weather exceed 40°C (104°F), avoid using the static film.
6. Take the Windshield Side Mount and the Windshield Side Mount cover **(DO NOT open it up yet)**.
7. See [#optional-prepare-your-magmount-only-if-you-redo-the-vhb](magmount-installation.md#optional-prepare-your-magmount-only-if-you-redo-the-vhb "mention")  applying VHB on Magmount. Remember to **clamp your mount** **and VHB** after you apply the VHB on the Magmount.
8. **(Important)** The ideal application temperature for VHB is above 70°F or 21°C. The minimum application temperature is 50°F and 10°C. If the temperature is lower than the minimum required, you can try to heat up the application area before and after attaching the magmount. Use common sense when heating the application area and avoid overheating or leaving it unattended. The VHB also need the above minimum required temperature for curing. Please leave it at least 24 hours or 1.5x the curing time recommended by 3M. Below is a snippet of recommended bond time from the 3M datasheet.\
   ![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)
9. If you are using an angle wedge, please **DO NOT DOUBLE LAYER the VHB** between the angle wedge and windshield mount. Double-layering might cause the mount to be unstable.\
   If there is VHB on both side of the angle wedge, peel one side off. And use adhesion promoter when attaching the windshield mount to the angle wedge.\
   So the setup should be: **VHB - Angle Wedge - VHB (Only one layer of VHB) - Windshield Mount**
10. If you decide to use the Comma Mount adapter, instead of redoing the VHB for winshield mount, please **DO NOT DOUBLE LAYER the VHB** between the comma mount adapter and windshield mount\
    If there is VHB on the Comma Mount Adapter, peel it off. And use adhesion promoter when attaching the windshield mount to the comma mount adapter.\
    The setup should be: **Comma Mount Adapter - VHB (Only one layer of VHB)- Windshield Mount**
11. Attach the Windshield Side Mount to the Static film if you applied it in step 5, or attach it to the windshield if the static film isn't applied. Try not to leave bubbles in VHB. Install it at a warm temperature and push firmly for optimal contact. During the time when VHB is curing, push firmly every hour to achieve optimal adhesion.&#x20;

10. Stick the magmount holder around the magmount and click it on. \
    Make sure it "holds" the magmounts on the sides.\
    This magmount holder will hold your magmount in place if the VHB peels off. It is unlikely that with the adhesive promoter applied, the VHB still peels off from the magmount; but the holder acts as a last line of defence.

11. Connect the 45cm Type-C cable to the Windshield Side Mount
12. Connect the other side of the Type C cable to the harness box. Use the cable organizers **(Optional)** to tidy up the cable if needed.

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/IMG_7164.jpg" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

13. Take the Device Side Mount and slide it onto the Comma Device\
    \*\*There is a galvanized steel plate added to reduce the magnetic field. It might cause scratches on your Comma device. \
    If you **do not encounter a "Fan malfunction" issue** while using the magmount, the galvanized steel plate is **not a mandatory part**; you can remove the galvanized steel plate before installing the Device Side Mount (warning: the plate could be very sharp on the edges)\
    The steel plate on the device mount shown in the picture below is the galvanized steel plate. It is stuck on the magmount by magnets and can be removed easily.

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/device 1.jpg" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

13. Use the 13cm Type C cable to connect the Device Side Mount to the Comma Device

<div><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/IMG_2281.JPG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/IMG_2283.JPG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

14. _**For Magmount set screw instructions, Magmount Warning**_: (Set screw is **optional** for Magmount) Only tighten the set screw if the mount is loose on your comma device. \
    By design, the mount should be a very tight fit with your comma device, and it has been tested on both C3 and C3X. \
    The set screw is there if you are using a comma clone device and the mount is loose on your device. \
    \
    Use the Allen Key to tighten the set screw on the Device Side Mount\
    **Please do not over-tighten it**, as the screw is only intended to prevent movement. \
    Over-tightening it will cause the breakage of the mounting bracket

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/IMG_2282.JPG" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

15. Tighten it just enough that there is a gap between the mount and the device. Make sure this line is **straight, not curved** when you tighten the set screw.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Set screw.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

16. Carefully remove the Windshield Side Mount Cover and attach the Device Side Mount to the Windshield Side Mount. **Be cautious,** as the magnet is very strong and can pinch your fingers.
17. &#x20;Use the bubble level **(Optional)** to ensure the Comma Device is level

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/IMG_7132.jpg" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

22. Use the Tilt Level meter (**Optional**) to confirm proper installation.\
    If it is not level, then an angle wedge might be needed.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/IMG_7136-2.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

23. The installation process is complete. Please wait for VHB to cure, and you are all set.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/IMG_7220-2.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

24. Please keep the Windshield Side Mount Cover for future use. Reattach it after removing the Comma Device to prevent short-circuiting the mount.
