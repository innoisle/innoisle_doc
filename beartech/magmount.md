### üö® Update for V2 Magmount Se&#x74;**:**&#x20;

**Magmount V2** is **now available!** ‚Äî heat-tested, screw-fastened, fan-safe, stronger hold (plus a travel rack option)

After 11 months of feedback and **hundreds of hours of 65‚Äì85 ¬∞C soak + heat-cycle testing**, Magmount V2 is ready. We listened, broke things, fixed them, and iterated until it sticks (literally). Huge thanks to everyone who waited and sent detailed reports‚Äîyou shaped V2.&#x20;

**What‚Äôs new vs V1 (quick hits):**

* **Sticks better:** Thicker 3M VHB for curved windshields + **pre-applied VHB** on the windshield mount side. **Adhesion promoter kit** included. Included **Magmount holder** acts like last line of defense, hold your Magmount in place.
* **No more glue failures:** Device mount is now **mechanically fastened** with **6 heat-set inserts + screws** near the bracket for even load. Survived \~**1 week at 85 ¬∞C** in chamber tests.
* **New C3X Fan friendly:** Added a **galvanized steel shield** between magnet and device to cut magnetic field \~**80%**‚Äîaddresses the C3X slow-fan concern. _**(Optional to use, if you do not want it, you can remove it)**_
* **Stronger hold:** Larger magnet = about **+50%** total magnetic strength.
* **Tough cabling:** Upgraded to a **braided cable** for better wear resistance.
* **Simpler buying:** One kit, **all accessories included** (no more tier confusion).

**Options if magnets aren‚Äôt your thing:**\
We also built a **Slidemount** (a sliding quick mount) that locks mechanically.\

## What is a Dummy mount?

A: Depends on your use case. Premium has one **dummy mount** that offer a way to mount your device under dash or steering wheel when you car is in park. Potential thief can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs under the steering wheel or under dash from peeking over the window.\
Premium also has more mounting accessories that help make the mount stick better.\
There is no circuitry inside the dummy mount. You can **only hang your device for storage**.

I wrote this one Reddit, and this is the reason why we have a dummy mount:\
The Magnetic mount solution from the community doesn't address this issue very well. I'm too lazy to store it in the glove box or the center console. Think about the process: You have to go into your glove box, reach for the device, take it out of the box if you don't want to scratch it, reach over the windshield, and mount it every time you enter the car. That's too much work!\
This got me thinking, and I came up with a solution. In the premium set, I included a dummy mount. You can stick the dummy mount under the dash and then attach your device to it for storage. When you enter the car, grab your device and attach it to the real mount on the windshield before you even sit.\
You still get everything you need from Essential if you just need a quick-mount. The Beartech Magmount is a clean and tidy solution for storing it, hiding away from thieves, and no more overheating when you start the car because the foot well area is colder and away from the sun.

{% embed url="https://www.reddit.com/r/Comma_ai/comments/1gctg53/magnetic_quick_release_mount_from/" %}

## What sets it apart from other Magnetic mount solutions:

1. 24 pogo pins enable full-feature type-c connections.
2. The internal data connection pair is length-matched for better signal transmission.
3. 8 pogo pins are dedicated to the power rail.
4. 17mm total thickness, slimmer design.
5. Gold-plated pogo pin and type-c cable.
6. Built-in 1/4-inch thread fits with the camera tripod screw.
7. Reversible mount orientation (only one orientation is recommended for openpilot use).
8. Windshield mount cover to avoid short circuit.
9. A dummy mount is used to hide your device under the dashboard in the premium set.
10. A built-in pull tab is on the side for ease of use.
11. 45N splitting force for the comfort of use without worry about unexpected disconnect.&#x20;
12. 10k cycles of torture test passed.
13. Run over bump test passed.
14. -20¬∞C/-4¬∞F Freezer test passed (incoming Canadian winter test).
15. 12V 3Amp high power temperature test passed.

#### Vehicles that require Angle Wedge **(only based on limited user feedback)** **If you are using an angle wedge for the original comma mount setup, then you will also need one for your magmount:**

* Toyota Highlander (8 degree)
* Honda Pilot (8 degree)
* Ford F150 (8 degree)
* Ford Maverick (8 degree)
* Rivian Truck & SUV  (8 degree)
* Ram 1500  (8 degree)
* And any windshield that makes your comma device tilt more than 5 degree
