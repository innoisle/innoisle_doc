<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/画板 1 拷贝.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

4. Rotate the 2m tape measure horizontally

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/IMG_7114-2-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

8. Use the IPA wipes **(VHB Tape pack)** to thoroughly clean the marked area on the windshield
