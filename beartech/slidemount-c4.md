#### 💡 What are these add-ons? (Quick Guide)

**Suction Rack**: A non-permanent mounting solution perfect for tinted windshield, rental cars or travel. It allows you to mount your device without using sticky tape on the windshield. It is specially redesigned for C4. It will be compatible with C4 Slidemount

**CPL Filter (Circular Polarizer)**: Sunglasses for your Comma cameras. These filters reduce windshield glare and dashboard reflections, helping the OpenPilot model see the road more clearly in bright sunlight. _(Note: Not recommended if you have ceramic windshield tint)._\

**IR (Infrared) Filter**: A small filter that covers your car's rearview mirror sensor. It prevents the Comma device's night-vision light from confusing your auto-dimming mirror, ensuring your mirror still dims correctly at night.\

#### 🛠️ For Previous C3 Slidemount Owners (Limited Qty)

_**Please read carefully before choosing these options.**_

**Addon A: C3 Slidemount Convert Kit** ($19 USD)

* What it does: Converts your old C3 Slidemount into a C4 Slidemount.
* Important: This is a permanent DIY modification. You will need to dismantle your old mount. Once converted, it will no longer work with your C3 device.
* Who is this for? Only choose this if you are fully switching to C4 and will never need to mount your C3/C3X again.

**Addon B: C3 Device-Side Mount (Compatible with C4 Base)** ($19 USD)

* What it does: Allows you to mount a C3/C3X onto the new C4 Slidemount device side.
* Requirement: You must also purchase a C4 Slidemount (or the Transfer Kit above) to use this.
* Who is this for? Choose this if you want to use both a C3 and a C4 on the same vehicle.
* _Includes: 1x Device-side mount for C3 (fits C4 rail)._



## **Product Highlights**

1. CNC aluminum C4 holding bracket (at the center)
2. All screwed-in design with no epoxy or any adhesive on the structural parts.

4. Curved mounting surface on the windshield side to better fit any windshield.
5. Right-angle USB-C cable.
6. Together with the Side Slide mechanism for maximum top space saving.&#x20;

**And features that users liked from the last Slidemount for C3X:**
