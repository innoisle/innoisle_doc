## Installation Guide

The installation instruction for SASCM is basically the same as ASCM. While locating the ASCM, you will find the other port for SASCM.

Please refer to ASCM's installation instruction:

This is how you connect older style harness: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bAoENo8edsbknXUx6bcx-L0-9dbgItJRCfd6DIyGDN0/edit?tab=t.0\
For the new ASCM harness, please locate the ASCM module and run the harness like a normal openpilot setup.
