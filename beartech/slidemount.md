# Slidemount Description

## Slidemount Pre-Order available now!

We’ve heard your requests, and we're excited to introduce the **Beartech Slidemount**! After the success of the Magmount, we’re offering a **pre-order** for the Slidemount, available in **Essential** and **Pioneer** bundles.

**Why Did We Create the Slidemount?**

The **Beartech Slidemount** was designed in response to community feedback:

1. Users wanted a **quick-mount solution** that offers physical contact, as some felt uncomfortable using the **Magmount**.
2. **Current Slidemount solutions** require a lot of space to install and remove, so we designed ours to require only **half the space** for a more compact and efficient experience.

## Where to pre-order:

## Essential Kit VS Premium Kit

What is included in Essential Kit:

* 1 x **Windshield Slidemount** (with VHB tape pre-applied)
* 1 x **Device Slidemount**
* 1 x **15cm (6-inch) Type-C Cable**
* 1 x **45cm (\~18-inch) Type-C Cable**
* 1 x **Tightening Kit**
* 2 x **VHB Tapes and Clean Kits**
* 2 x **Adhesion Promoters**

The **Essential Bundle** includes the core components for mounting, while the **Premium Bundle** offers the same components plus a **free upgrade** to the latest version of the Slidemount, redeemable a year later.



## Add-ons

The **Slidemount** will not include a dummy mount like the **Magmount** to keep the product clean and concise, as many users didn’t understand its purpose.&#x20;

If you still wish to protect your Comma device, we will have our **storage case** available soon.&#x20;

Additionally, accessories and add-ons such as the **Angle Wedge**, **Comma Mount Adapter**, and **OP Device Stand** are shared between the **Magmount** and **Slidemount**.

You can find them at:
