# Slidemount Description

## Description:

We’ve heard your requests, and we're excited to introduce the **Beartech Slidemount**!&#x20;

**Why Did We Create the Slidemount?**

The **Beartech Slidemount** was designed in response to community feedback:

1. Users wanted a **quick-mount solution** that offers physical contact, as some felt uncomfortable using the **Magmount**.
2. **Current Slidemount solutions** require a lot of space to install and remove, so we designed ours to require only **half the space** for a more compact and efficient experience.

## Where to buy:

Slidemount set and single windshield mount: [https://shop.tlbb.ca/products/beartech-slidemount](https://shop.tlbb.ca/products/beartech-slidemount)

Add-on Mounts for Magmount/ Slidemount: [https://shop.tlbb.ca/products/magmount-addon](https://shop.tlbb.ca/products/magmount-addon)



#### Vehicles that require Angle Wedge:

* Toyota Highlander (8 degree)
* Honda Pilot (8 degree)
* Ford F150 (8 degree)
* Ford Maverick (8 degree)
* Rivian Truck & SUV  (8 degree)
* And any windshield that makes your comma device tilt more than 5 degree

## Add-ons

The **Slidemount** will not include a dummy mount like the **Magmount** to keep the product clean and concise, as many users didn’t understand its purpose.&#x20;

If you still wish to protect your Comma device, we have our **storage case**.&#x20;
