All the electronic components from innoisle on this device are AEC-Q100 & AEC-Q200 qualified. All the connecting parts are from original equipment manufacturers. Assembled in Canada. 3D printed case with ASA automotive grade and UV resistant plastic.

## Notice

Comma released a new update for their new harness box in July 2024 . There is no more RJ45 port from the harness box and therefore, pedal is not supported by the new Comma harness box.

I have released my harness box; please choose the correct one for purchase.

There are two versions, 2x9 pin (new version by comma) and 2x13 pin (old version by comma). Please check your harness before ordering.

If you need the individual harness box, you can find it at : [https://shop.tlbb.ca/products/openpilot-harness-box-v1-2x13-pin-and-v2-2x9-pin-with-rj-45-port](https://shop.tlbb.ca/products/openpilot-harness-box-v1-2x13-pin-and-v2-2x9-pin-with-rj-45-port)

## Installation Guide

#### Toyota:&#x20;

For installation, Jason Moreau made a wonderful video on how to install my Smart DSU and Pedal on his Rav4. He used our older version pedal and SDSU, but the installation method is similar. Please refer to his video:&#x20;

Or you can refer to Kevin's video on installing the pedal on Toyota. All installation processes are similar for different vehicles.&#x20;
