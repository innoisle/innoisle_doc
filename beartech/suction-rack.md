The Suction Rack is a versatile mounting solution designed for Comma 3 and Comma 3X users who prefer a **non-permanent, reusable installation method**. Responding to high demand from the community, this rack allows you to securely mount your device without the need for VHB tape on your windshield. It’s ideal for drivers who frequently move their device between vehicles or use rental cars.

**Key Features:**

* **Angle Adjustability (0°, 8°, 16°):**\
  The Suction Rack includes three interchangeable angle inserts, allowing users to adapt to different windshield slopes. Whether your vehicle has a nearly vertical windshield or a steep rake, you can achieve the optimal viewing angle for your comma device.
* **Dual Suction Options:**\
  To provide flexibility for different use cases, the rack includes two types of suction cups:
  * **Sticky Suction Cup (“Sticky Cup”):** Features a lightly adhesive silicone surface for a stronger, more reliable hold. This is recommended for **long-term use** but remains reusable when kept clean.
  * **Standard Suction Cup:** A classic rubber vacuum cup that’s slightly less grippy but easier to attach, remove, and reuse across multiple vehicles.
* **Built-in Bubble Level:**\
  For hassle-free installation, the rack integrates a mini bubble level in its center. This feature allows users to quickly check and adjust the rack’s position for a perfectly horizontal setup, improving camera alignment and overall system performance.
* **Compatible Mounting:**\
  The rack is designed to work in conjunction with your existing **Magmount** or **Slidemount** (required, not included). Once installed, your comma device attaches securely and can be removed or repositioned as needed.
* Also **compatible with DSLR and GoPro** with the ¼ tripod screw included.

**What is Included:**

* 1× Suction Rack Base with Integrated Bubble Level
* 3× Angle Inserts (0°, 8°, 16°)
* 1× Pair of Sticky Suction Cups
* 1× Pair of Standard Suction Cups
* 2× Decorative Star End Caps
* 1× Mounting Hardware Kit (screws, bars, and tools)

#### **Recommended Use Cases**

* **Rental or Shared Vehicles:** Avoid leaving any residue on windshields when moving your comma device between cars.
* **Frequent Travellers:** Reusable and easy to pack for use in multiple vehicles.
* **Non-Permanent Installs:** For users who prefer not to apply permanent adhesives like VHB tape.
