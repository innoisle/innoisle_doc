## Product Description - OBD Power

OBD Power is the original Comma power.

It provides 12V power to your Comma device via the OBD port. \
12V from the OBD port usually stays alive after the car is off, which means your Comma device will stay on.\
It also connects 1 CAN bus from your comma device to the OBD port.

You will need an additional ethernet cable (again, please avoid flat noodle cables) to connect.
