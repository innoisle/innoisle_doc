### Installation Steps

#### Magmount Windshield and Device Side Installation Guide

1. Place the Magnetic angle gauge **(Installation kit)** on the floor to make sure the ground is level

2. Place the 1.5m tape measure **(Installation kit)** vertically on the far left and right side of your windshield outside the vehicle. Use tape to secure if needed

3. &#x20;Center the 2m tape measure **(Installation kit)** on the windshield and mark 5cm down the radar

4. Rotate the 2m tape measure horizontally

5. &#x20;Mark the position where the Magmount will be installed
6. Use the Wet wipes **(VHB Tape pack)** to clean the marked area on the windshield inside the vehicle
7. Use the Dry wipes **(VHB Tape pack)** to further clean the same area on the windshield
8. Use the IPA wipes **(VHB Tape pack)** to thoroughly clean the marked area on the windshield
9. Apply the Static film **(VHB Tape pack)** to the windshield. **Note**: If temperatures exceed 40°C (104°F), avoid using the static film.
10. Take the Windshield Side Mount and the Windshield Side Mount cover **(DO NOT open it up yet)**.
11. Wipe the back of the Windshield Side Mount with the IPA wipe.
12. Stick the VHB tape to the Windshield Side Mount
13. Attach the Windshield Side Mount to the Static film you applied in step 9

14. Connect the 45cm Type-C cable to the Windshield Side Mount
15. Connect the other side of the Type C cable to the harness box. Use the cable organizers **(installation kit)** to tidy up the cable if needed.

16. Take the Device Side Mount **(Device Mount Pack)** and slide it onto the Comma Device
17. Use the 13cm Type C cable **(Device Mount Pack)** to connect the Device Side Mount to the Comma Device

18. _**Warning**_: Only tighten the set screw if the mount is loose on your comma device. By design, the mount should be a very tight fit with your comma device, and it has been tested on both C3 and C3X. The set screw is there if you are using a comma clone device and the mount is loose on your device. \
    Apply a drop of Thread Locker **(Magmount Premium)** to the set screw. Use the Allen Key **(Magmount Premium)** to tighten the set screw on the Device Side Mount

19. Tighten it just enough that there is a gap between the mount and the device. Make sure this line is straight, not curved when you tighten the set screw.

20. Carefully remove the Windshield Side Mount Cover and attach the Device Side Mount to the Windshield Side Mount. **Be cautious,** as the magnet is very strong and can pinch your fingers.
21. &#x20;Use the bubble level **(Installation Kit)** to ensure the Comma Device is level

22. Use the Tilt Level meter (Installation Kit) to confirm proper installation.

23. You are all set to go!

24. Please keep the Windshield Side Mount Cover for future use. Reattach it after removing the Comma Device to prevent short-circuiting the mount.

#### Magmount Dummy Side Installation Guide

1. Choose a location to store your Comma Device.
2. Clean the surface using the Wet & Dry Wipes and IPA Wipes **(VHB Tape pack)**.
3. If attaching to a window or glass surface, you may use a static film. For other surfaces, use it with the adhesion promoter **(adhesion promoter pack)**.
4. Take the Dummy Side Mount and apply a piece of VHB Tape **(VHB Tape pack)** to it.
5. Now you can use the Dummy Mount to securely store your Comma Device when it’s not in use!
