# Slidemount Installation Guide - After 2025Aug1st

\*Disclaimer: This is a guide only.

**This installation guide applies to the magmount purchased after July 2025.**\


## **Set Screw Warning:**

**\*Over-tightening the set screw could break your slidemount**

**Set screw is required for Slidemount**: \
\- Lose the protruded set screw (if any) so it won't block you from installing the slidemount\
\- After attaching the mount to device, tighten the pre-install set screws at the left and right side of the Slidemount.\
\- Tighten it **just enough** that you can't move the Slidemount. \
\- **Do not over-tighten it**, as the screw is small and is only intended to prevent movement. \
\- Over-tightening it will cause the **breakage of the mounting bracket**.&#x20;

**\*\*Example of an over-tightened set screw:**\
The set screw in the picture below is over-tightened way too much. \
Otherwise, the mounting bracket could break (as shown in the picture)

### **Compatibility Warning:**&#x20;

**Slidemount may not support 3rd party comma devices.**\
**We don't guarantee compatibility of Slidemount on any device other than the comma C3X, C3 and C2. Thank you for understanding.**

## Installation Steps

### Before installing the slidemount, please find the description for each component in your package here:

[slidemount.md](slidemount.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### (Optional) Prepare your magmount: (ONLY if you redo the VHB)

1. All slidemount and angle wedge already come with **pre-applied VHB**. \
   If you would like to **redo the VHB**, then please follow the steps to prep it.\
   Please make sure you **apply the adhesion promoter** before applying the VHB.&#x20;
2. Warning: Apply the VHB tape to the slidemount, angle wedges or comma mount adapter first before you stick it on the windshield. And apply the VHB in warm temp.\
   If you are reapplying the VHB tape, Clean the surface with isopropyl alcohol and ensure that no residue remains.
3. **(Important)** The ideal application temperature for VHB is above 70°F or 21°C. The minimum application temperature is 50°F and 10°C. If the temperature is lower than the minimum required, you can try to heat up the application area before and after attaching the magmount. Use common sense when heating the application area and avoid overheating or leaving it unattended. The VHB also need the above minimum required temperature for curing. Please leave it at least 24 hours or 1.5x the curing time recommended by 3M. Below is a snippet of recommended bond time from the 3M datasheet.

5. Take the Windshield Side Mount.
6. Wipe the back of the Windshield Side Mount with the IPA wipe.
7. Apply **adhesion promoter to every surface (except on glass)**  that the VHB is going to stick to and let it dry. (If you have windshield tint, please try it on a small area first, some tint does not do well with the adhesion promoter)
8. Apply VHB tape to the Windshield Side Mount.
9. **Clamp or use weight** on the complete slidemount for **at least 5 hours** so VHB makes perfect contact to the surface. **Every VHB-connected surface** needs to be clamped. (The complete slidemount here means slidemount with angle wedges and VHB or slidemount with mount adapter sticked together. )

### Slidemount Windshield and Device Side Installation Guide

1. Mark the **center position** where the Slidemount will be installed

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/IMG_7114-2-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

2. Use the Wet wipes **(VHB Tape pack)** to clean the marked area on the windshield inside the vehicle
3. Use the Dry wipes **(VHB Tape pack)** to further clean the same area on the windshield
4. Use the IPA wipes **(VHB Tape pack)** to thoroughly clean the marked area on the windshield
5. Apply the Static film **(VHB Tape pack)** to the windshield. **Note**: If your local weather exceed 40°C (104°F), avoid using the static film.
6. Take the Windshield Side Mount.
7. See [#optional-prepare-your-magmount-only-if-you-redo-the-vhb](slidemount-installation.md#optional-prepare-your-magmount-only-if-you-redo-the-vhb "mention")  applying VHB on slidemount. Remember to **clamp your mount** **and VHB** after you apply the VHB on the Slidemount.
8. **(Important)** The ideal application temperature for VHB is above 70°F or 21°C. The minimum application temperature is 50°F and 10°C. If the temperature is lower than the minimum required, you can try to heat up the application area before and after attaching the magmount. Use common sense when heating the application area and avoid overheating or leaving it unattended. The VHB also need the above minimum required temperature for curing. Please leave it at least 24 hours or 1.5x the curing time recommended by 3M. Below is a snippet of recommended bond time from the 3M datasheet.\
   ![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)
9. **(Important)** Please **leave enough room to slide the mount in and out**. Please **leave minimum 3.5cm (1.4 inch)**&#x20;
10. If you are using an angle wedge, please **DO NOT DOUBLE LAYER the VHB** between the angle wedge and windshield mount. Double-layering might cause the mount to be unstable.\
    If there is VHB on both side of the angle wedge, peel one side off. And use adhesion promoter when attaching the windshield mount to the angle wedge.\
    So the setup should be: **VHB - Angle Wedge - VHB (Only one layer of VHB) - Windshield Mount**
11. If you decide to use the Comma Mount adapter, instead of redoing the VHB for winshield mount, please **DO NOT DOUBLE LAYER the VHB** between the comma mount adapter and windshield mount\
    If there is VHB on the Comma Mount Adapter, peel it off. And use adhesion promoter when attaching the windshield mount to the comma mount adapter.\
    The setup should be: **Comma Mount Adapter - VHB (Only one layer of VHB)- Windshield Mount**
12. Attach the Windshield Side Mount to the Static film if you applied it in step 5, or attach it to the windshield if the static film isn't applied. Try not to leave bubbles in VHB. Install it at a warm temperature and push firmly for optimal contact. During the time when VHB is curing, push firmly every hour to achieve optimal adhesion.&#x20;

11. Connect the 45cm Type-C cable to the Windshield Side Mount
12. Connect the other side of the Type C cable to the harness box. Use the cable organizers **(Optional)** to tidy up the cable if needed.

13. Take the Device Side Mount and slide it onto the Comma Device\
    \*\*Depending on the version you received, there might be a galvanized steel plate added to reduce the magnetic field. It might cause scratches on your Comma device. \
    If you **do not encounter a "Fan malfunction" issue** while using the slidemount, the galvanized steel plate is **not a mandatory part**; you can remove the galvanized steel plate before installing the Device Side Mount (warning: the plate could be very sharp on the edges)\
    The steel plate on the device mount is the galvanized steel plate. It is stuck on the slidemount by magnets and can be removed easily.



13. Use the 13cm Type C cable to connect the Device Side Mount to the Comma Device

15. For Slidemount set screw instruction (**Set screw is required for Slidemount**): \
    \- Tighten the pre-install set screws at the left and right side of the Slidemount.\
    \- Tighten it **just enough** that you can't move the Slidemount.\
    \- **Do not over-tighten it**, as the screw is small and is only intended to prevent movement.

**\*\*Example of an over-tightened set screw:**\
The set screw in the picture below is over-tightened way too much. \
The mounting bracket could break (as shown in the picture)

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/企业微信截图_17537360466275.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

16. Carefully attach the Device Side Mount to the Windshield Side Mount. **Be cautious,** as the magnet is very strong and can pinch your fingers.
17. &#x20;Use the bubble level **(Optional)** to ensure the Comma Device is level

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/IMG_7132.jpg" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

22. Use the Tilt Level meter (**Optional**) to confirm proper installation.\
    If it is not level, then an angle wedge might be needed.&#x20;

23. The installation process is complete. Please wait for VHB to cure, and you are all set.

24. Please keep the Windshield Side Mount Cover for future use. Reattach it after removing the Comma Device to prevent short-circuiting the mount.
