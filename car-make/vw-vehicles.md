# VW Vehicles

### Vehicles require Pedal

#### Volkswagen:&#x20;

* VW PQ platform&#x20;

***

### What is needed:

1. [Pedal](../beartech/comma-pedal-description-and-installation-guide.md)
2. [Splitter](../beartech/obd-power-and-splitter-description.md) (only if you have an RJ45 Comma Power connected)
3. [Harness box](../beartech/harness-and-harness-box-description.md) (To connect the pedal, you will need a harness box with rj45 port)

### How to identify which version of harness box is needed:

1. If you have a harness box with rj45 port - you DO NOT need another harness box to use pedal
2. If have a harness box purchased from Comma, with no rj45 port - you will need a 2x9 pin box
3. If you plan to purchase the harness + box (GM only) from me, then it is 2x13 pin box
4. If you purchased a used harness with no box, please DM me the picture of your harness. (the old ones before 2024 June are 2x13 pin)
5. If you purchased a customized harness for Tesla, you will need a 2x13 pin box
